# Presentation guidelines

:bulb: **Tips on what to include in your final presentation** :bulb:

Before you get to preparing the presentation, go through the [evaluation criteria](https://github.com/Global-Travel-Hackathon) to know what the jury will be focused on. 

To help you a bit, we suggest a simple guideline on how the presentation could look like:

* What problem are you solving and why is it important? What is unique about it?
* How does it relate to the three main topics?
* If you have a demo, show it.
* What data and APIs did you use for your project?
* Were there any tech challenges you needed to overcome?
* Did you use a unique technique or many different components?
* If you donâ€™t have a functional demo, present the user journey and focus on the uniqueness of your idea and your solution. 

You have **5 minutes to present your project** followed by a **3-minutes QA session**.
