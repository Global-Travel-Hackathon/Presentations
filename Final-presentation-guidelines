# Presentation guidelines

## :idea: Tips on what to include in your final presentation:

Before you get to preparing the presentation, go through the evaluation criteria to be aware of what the jury will focus on. 
To help you with the presentation, below we suggest a guideline on how the presentation should look like:
* What problem are you solving and why is it important? What is unique about it?
* How does it relate to the three main topics?
* If you have a demo, show it.
* What data and API’s did you use for your project?
* Where there any tech challenges you needed to overcome?
* Did you a unique technique or many different components?
* If you don’t have a functional demo, present the user journey and focus on the uniqueness of your idea and your solution.

You will have 5 minutes to present your project followed by a QA session (up to 3 minutes).
