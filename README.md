## :trophy: Winners of the Global Travel Hackathon :trophy:

:tada: The winners of the Global Round of our #HackTravel, and of ‚Ç¨4,000 for their travels are: **Penguin Bots team** :tada:

The Penguin Bots üêß won second place in Barcelona and got a wild card to participate in the Global Round, where the Kiwi.com jury appreciated their Chrome extension supporting local music groups.

What exactly did they appreciate?

We were excited about how they connected travel with music in the pre-trip phase. This way, they can inspire others when searching for a weekend getaway ‚Äî or get you into the mood for visiting places far away. Plus, the fact that Elises and Oriol delivered a working solution within the given hackathon time and focused on simplicity, convinced us that they are the winners.
